## Welcome to my dotfiles

There are some things I need to clarify:

- I'm currently using [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/), an Arch Linux based distro by [@dhh](https://x.com/dhh).
- The installer.sh is fully operational. It clones [@davilera's dotfiles](https://github.com/davilera/dotfiles) basics for omarchy that include mainly two things I use as they are: lazyvim and bash ones. Also adds some modifications as custom bash aliases or hyprland and waybar settings.

Feel free to use it in your setup or ask me anything.
