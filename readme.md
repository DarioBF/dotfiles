## Welcome to my dotfiles!

There are some things I need to clarify:
- I'm currently using debian trixie (testing), installed with gnome which also have the [Pop Shell extension installed](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell/)
- On top of Gnome I installed Sway, but in this repo you can check my previous attempts to use i3 and it's dependencies (which actually works pretty well)
- If you are interested in the sway config and its dependencies, you can check de sway config file, where dependencies are listed.

Feel free to use it in your setup or ask me anything.

My current setup includes:
- Sway and some dependencies: You can check them on the sway config file
