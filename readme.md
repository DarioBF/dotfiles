## Welcome to my dotfiles!

There are some things I need to clarify:
- I'm currently using debian trixie (testing), installed with gnome which also have the [Pop Shell extension installed](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell/)
- On top of Gnome I installed Sway, but in this repo you can check my previous attempts to use i3 and it's dependencies (which actually works pretty well)
- If you are interested in the sway config and its dependencies, you can check de sway config file, where dependencies are listed.
- The installer.sh is not fully operational, I should test it someday... But it has most of the commands I use to setup the environment.
- There are some config files i'm not currently using, as i3 dotfiles, but those worked for me someday.

Feel free to use it in your setup or ask me anything.
